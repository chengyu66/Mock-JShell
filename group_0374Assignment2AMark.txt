Your team's Phase II grade is based on this scale:

    http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/newstudents/transition/academic/grading

The way we graded is as follows: your team starts with an A+. When errors and
problems are found, you will lose 0, 1, 2, or 3 letter steps, depending on the
severity. As an example, if you lost two steps, your team would earn an A-:

     A+ -> A
     A -> A-

You were asked to follow the Scrum process. A big part of that is to maintain
a product backlog and a sprint backlog.

==== Product and Sprint backlogs ==== [up to -6]

- [ ]  SB items not taken directly from PB -1
- [ ]  SB items not broken down into smaller steps -1
- [ ]  PB, SB uses noticeably bad grammar and/or spelling -2
