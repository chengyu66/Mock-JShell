What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Brainstormed the relationship between the Commend class and JShell.
    - Finish the History Class, the subclass of Commend
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finished the coding of some subclasses of Command Class.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - I still consider using the Arraylist, linkList or Tree in FileSystem.
