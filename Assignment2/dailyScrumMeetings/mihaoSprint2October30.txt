What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Complete the coding of Directory, file and History(the subclass of Command)
    - Use the Directory and file class in FileSystem class.
    - Help coding the trace method in FileSystem.
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Find a more efficient way to code the methods in History Class.
    - Finish the comments for the classes I created.
    - Start to code other subclasses of Command
    

Am I blocked on anything?
    - find the way to compare file and directory in FileSystem.
