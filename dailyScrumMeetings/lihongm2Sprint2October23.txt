What did I work on in the last three days?
    - I and my team members came to a solid version of CRCcards
    and we uploaded them
    - I started brainstorming for the Command I'm in charge of which are
    PushdDIR, Popd, StackDirectory
    - Jshell is redistruted to one of my teammates
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Get PushedDIR, Popd and StackDirectory done

Am I blocked on anything?
    - 2 Quizes and 2 midterm exams in the next 3 days
